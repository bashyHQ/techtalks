This is the source code of link:http://www.techtalks.xyz/[TechTalks.xyz] a community of tech videos and presentations. It is build on top of the great link:http://beavy.xyz/[Beavy community building framework] and closely working with the team (big overlap to be precise). The goal is to have this repo mostly contain the local changes and configuration necessary to make techtalks float but have all shared in beavy directly. So, in doubt, you probably want to send your PR right there instead of here.
