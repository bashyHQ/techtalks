= Vagrant setup

We are using a vagrant box to provide a quick development environment
for you to get started with. You will need

 - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 5.1.10
 - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) >= 4.3

To setup the vagrant virtual machine, from beavy root run:

```
vagrant up --provision
```

When run for the first time, this might take a while as vagrant
has to download the latest version of the virtual box image. Once
this is done and everything has been set up, you should see a big
green message welcoming you and asking you to run `start.sh`. **Before you link:Development-Running.adoc[can do that], make sure you properly link:Development-App-Setup.adoc[set up your own app]!**
